Working with feature selection

Data files:

SystemDescriptor

datafile1 from github gaussian process.x (from quantum mechanics)

datafile2.x  (from rotation of molecules)

datafile3.x (two water molecules)

datafile4.x (three water molecules small)

datafile5.x (three water molecules huge)

Programs that generate data:

Geneerate random coordinates for N water molecules.py

Generate random coordinates H2O CH4 CO2.py

Programs that ganarate features:

Generate 2 distances features.py

Feature selection / elimination algorithms:
