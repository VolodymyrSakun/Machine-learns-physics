I have updated results keeping only the most important ones.
The best results that I have got so far marked as BEST FOR NOW.
Those are obtained by using three consecutive algorithms:
Elastic Net from sklearn gave me initial fit reducing the initial number of features to more reasonable number.
Backward sequential algorithm combined with search alternete solution based on correlation of features removed the rest features up to 2
The last 20 iterations have been stored to .xlsx file with detailed description of fit.
The last three columns of .xlsx files represent real (not normalized) coefficients and corresponding RMSE and R2
I want to mention that in order to have the best fit three important features that represent intermolecular distances to power -1 must be present.
Also I want to mention that set 3 gives smaller RMSE bur worth R2 for the same number of predictors.
Files procedure.txt describe briefly how each fit was obtained.
There are some plots as well.
