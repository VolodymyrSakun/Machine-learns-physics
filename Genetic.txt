Genetic algorithm
Parameters:
ChromosomeSize - number of features in chromosome to fit data
PopulationSize - number of chromosomes (parents) in population
MutationProbability - probability of mutation [0 .. 1]. If MutationProbability = 0.2 than the probability of crossover = 0.8
MutationInterval - how many genes in chromosome will be replaced by randomly chosen features from initial pool. Random selection from interval
EliteFraction - fracrion of good chromosomes that will be used for crossover. 
If PopulationSize = 100 and EliteFraction = 0.2 than 20 best chromosomes will be selected for crossover / mutation
CrossoverFractionInterval - proportion of number of genes for crossover. If CrossoverFractionInterval = [0.7, 0.3] and ChromosomeSize = 10
then 7 random genes from first chromosome and 3 random genes from second chromosome will produce new child
FractionOfCrossover - int(fraction NumberOfGood / NumberOfCrossover)
NumberOfCrossover = int(NumberOfGood / FractionOfCrossover)
IterationPerRecord - each IterationPerRecord iteration information about best fit will be shown on console
MinCorr = 0.8 # for ClassifyCorrelatedFeatures. Smalle value gives better result but works longer

If runs long enought gives results similar to ones from Elastic Net + Backward sequential + Search alternate
Gives better result aftr relatively short period of running if followed by ClassifyCorrelatedFeatures and FindAlternativeFit.
For now loop works until I press <CTRL>-<C> in console. After it performs adjustment and stores results (before and after adjustment) in .xlsx
